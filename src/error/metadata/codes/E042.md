This error occurs when a check workflow fails. This means that you proposed a schema that does not pass the configured checks. You can configure this behavior in the Checks -> Configuration view in [Apollo Studio](https://studio.apollographql.com/), and you can read more about client checks [here](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/studio/schema-checks/).
